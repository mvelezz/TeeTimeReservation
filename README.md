# TeeTimeReservation
The goal of this program is to build a mock tee time reservation system. As of right now, it has the ability to create new members and store those members in a txt file that is accessible when the program begins. 
The program also allows you to add members to available tee times.  I would like to at some point put the tee times in a file as well so that it can all be kept track of and not reset when the program closes.
I would also like to find a better way to reserve a tee time. As of right now you must time in the tee time as a String in order to match an available tee time. I would like to allow for something like an integer input to choose
a tee time.
